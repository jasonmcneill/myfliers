  # Core API
  
  The API requests inside this directory interact with the core API for the service. These endpoints are designed to be interface-agnostic, assuming that the caller is already authenticated and can provide a valid token (JWT).
  
  You should interact with the core API endpoints via adapters for each interface, used to authenticate and interact with the service.
